## OpenPDF 2.1.0

We are excited to announce the release of OpenPDF 2.1.0, which marks a major step forward for the project.

* Java 21 required: OpenPDF 2.1.0 now targets Java 21 LTS and benefits from its modern features and performance improvements.

* New Kotlin module: Build PDFs more easily using idiomatic Kotlin APIs and a DSL-inspired builder interface.

* Deprecated HtmlParser: We encourage migrating to openpdf-html for improved HTML rendering.

* Added openpdf-html module: A maintained fork of Flying Saucer for converting HTML to PDF, now part of the OpenPDF project.
